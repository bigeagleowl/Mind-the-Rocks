# Mind-the-Rocks!
This is a BBC [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/) multiplayer game where you have to avoid the falling rocks, and the player who avoids the rocks for the longest wins :-)

## How to use?
When the games powers up, you will see the spinning clock finger. When this finishes you are off and rocks will start drop from the top of the screen.  You are the pixel in the buttom row. You have to avoid the falling rocks by using the 2 microbit buttons. Button A (on left) moves you to the left and button B (on right) moves you to the right. If a rock hits you, it is game over.  The game them restarts - what fun! 

## Multiplayer Mode
To play with others:
1. **reset** the microbit using the reset button (which is the button on the opposite side of mircobit to the LEDs). Â 
1. When you see the spinning clock finger, **press and hold the button A** (on left).  When it sees others doing the same with their microbits, it lights a LED for each player who joins. 
1. When all have joined let go of button A. It will tell you which player number you are, and then it will start the game :-)
1. When you die you will the skull image, and microbit will wait till all player have finished.
1. The microbit will display the number of the player who won.
1. Automatially restarts the game, so that you more fun!


## Where did the Idea Come From?
I attended an [Oxford Codebar](https://codebar.io/oxford) session on Python programming for microbits where I was demoing the [A Staky Start Talk Timer](https://github.com/bigeagleowl/A-Shaky-Start-Talk-Timer). There, one of the Mentors was coding up a block drop game for the microbit.  If that was you I would love to credit you here.  This got me thinking that I could write a multi-player version.

## Trivia 
I coded up the very first version of the game whilst on holiday in the [Northumberland National Park](https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/).
