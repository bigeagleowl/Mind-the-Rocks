# Mind-the-Rocks!


This is a BBC [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/) multiplayer game where you have to avoid the falling rocks, and the player who avoids the rocks for the longest wins :-)

## Where Did the Idea Come From?
I attended an [Oxford Codebar](https://codebar.io/oxford) session on Python programming for microbits where I was demoing the [A Staky Start Talk Timer](https://github.com/bigeagleowl/A-Shaky-Start-Talk-Timer). There, one of the Mentors was coding up a block drop game for the microbit.  If that was you I would love to credit you here.  This got me thinking that I could write a multi-player version.

## Trivia 
I coded up the very first version of the game whilst on holiday in the [Northumberland National Park](https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/).
